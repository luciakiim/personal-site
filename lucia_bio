Hi, it's Lucia!

I'm a UPenn alumna working as a Business Development analyst at AQR Capital Management. I have interned at AQR (Business Development), Macquarie Investment Management (Client Group), VRB Labs (Marketing and Business Development), and the Veloz Group (SEO Writing). This is just the start of my professional career, and I'm excited to broaden my horizons and make high level client impact across a variety of spaces. 

In my free time, I love to stay busy trying new things--whether that's checking out a new restaurant <- (link this), finding a hidden hiking trail, or taking random classes (painting, salsa, and pottery so far ðŸ’ƒ). Since I was a little girl, I've enjoyed journaling and playing the piano, and these are my main creative outlets today. 

I'm always looking for food/book/article/song/shop/activity (really anything) suggestions, so let me know what you've been up to recently! You can contact me blah blah
